## One-pager & demo

A clean [**one-pager**](one-pager.html) (`one-pager.html`) states the whole pitch on a single
screen and prints to one PDF page — six pillars, each labeled `LIVE`, over an honest ledger of
what's live vs `ROADMAP`/`PLANNED`. Like everything here it's one dependency-free file.

```

## What MERIDIAN is now

A **browser-only AI workbench**. You bring your own API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint), load a project folder into your browser's memory, and ask questions. Every answer streams back with a **trace** — the reasoning steps, pinned to the exact files and lines they stand on, as clickable evidence chips that open the cited file at the cited range.

Underneath the chat, MERIDIAN is a **deterministic project-intelligence engine**: it understands the terrain of a project *before* a model enters the room. On load it indexes the project — symbols, import/importer edges, entry points, tests, packages — and shows a **PROJECT INTELLIGENCE** overview. The AI model is an optional reasoning layer on top of that understanding, not the foundation.

Don't want to use an API at all? The **LOCAL engine** (settings → PROVIDER → LOCAL) answers with **no key, no AI, and zero network**. It routes each question by intent and runs a real investigation over the project index, returning findings through the same trace + evidence-chip UI, honestly labeled `LOCAL · NO AI`. Every answer carries a verdict — **KNOWN LOCALLY** (structure, definitions, references, imports/importers, related files, recent changes, evidence) or **REQUIRES MODEL REASONING** (root-cause, synthesis, architectural recommendations). When a model *is* connected, MERIDIAN sends only the relevant evidence, never the whole repo.

The architecture *is* the privacy story:

- **No backend.** The whole product is static files on GitHub Pages. There is no server of ours to receive your data.
- **BYO key.** Requests go directly from the browser to the chosen provider's API under the user's own account. Keys live in localStorage only, one per provider.
- **Zero egress to us.** File contents and conversations exist in tab memory and vanish on close. Saved projects persist **metadata only** (file tree + settings) in IndexedDB.
- **Prompt caching.** On Anthropic, the stable context block is cached, so multi-turn conversations over a big project cost ~10× less on input after the first turn.

### The smart context engine

Medium and large codebases no longer blow the context window. In **SMART** mode (auto-enabled when the loaded project exceeds ~70% of the model's context) each question sends:

1. a **project map** — the full file tree with language-aware token counts, package roots marked (`◆ PACKAGE`, monorepo-aware: package.json / Cargo.toml / pyproject.toml / go.mod detected per directory), plus the heads of key files (READMEs, manifests, entry points — including the largest sub-packages');
2. the **most relevant files**, scored by type weight, recency (file *and* directory), path depth, and query keywords — debug-worded questions boost test files, onboarding-worded questions boost docs — greedily packed into an adjustable token budget (default ≤120K). Files too large to send whole are excerpted **with their true line numbers kept** and omitted ranges marked — so evidence citations stay verifiable in the viewer.

**FULL** mode (every checked file, whole) remains one click away. `[ PREVIEW SEND ]` shows exactly what the next question will transmit — map, file list, whole-vs-excerpt, token estimates — computed by the same code path as the real request. Skipped files (binary / oversized / pattern) are summarized in the rail with a `[ REVIEW SKIPPED ]` modal that can pull individual files back in — and a count badge on the CONTEXT toggle plus an actionable `[ REVIEW ]` toast on load make them impossible to miss.

### Grounding — the engine feeds the model

With `[ GROUND: ON ]` (default), every model question first runs Meridian's deterministic investigation locally, then attaches its **verified findings** — the exact `path:line` evidence — as a context block the model reasons on top of. The model is told to prefer citing those lines, so answers are anchored to what Meridian actually found rather than the model's guess. The grounding block is per-question and placed **after** the cached map/context, so Anthropic prompt caching of the stable prefix is preserved. It appears in `[ PREVIEW SEND ]` like everything else, and the toggle turns it off for a raw context-only request.

### Also on the bench

- **Project intelligence engine** *(deterministic, no API)* — on load MERIDIAN builds a structured index of the project (symbols, import/importer edges, entry points, tests, configs, docs, packages) and surfaces a **PROJECT INTELLIGENCE** overview of the terrain. This index powers the LOCAL engine and is always available regardless of provider.
- **LOCAL engine** *(no API)* — a provider that uses no key, no model, and no network. It routes each question by intent and runs a real investigation over the index: definitions (`def`), references (`refs`), importers/imports, related files, symbols, structure, tests, entry points, recent changes, plus `search` / `dir` / `recent` commands — all answered through the same trace + evidence-chip UI with a **KNOWN LOCALLY / REQUIRES MODEL REASONING** verdict, labeled `LOCAL · NO AI`. Interpretation questions honestly say a model is needed rather than fabricating an answer. Fully offline; keeps the zero-third-party-scripts guarantee.
- **Project memory** — save named projects (tree + selection + ignore patterns + context prefs, never contents). Folders opened via the File System Access API reload from disk in one click.
- **Ignore patterns** — per-project glob-lite filters applied at ingest, with a one-click **Suggest** that proposes common junk-file globs grounded in what you've actually loaded.
- **First-run demo** — new visitors can load a tiny bundled sample project and get a real answer from the **LOCAL** engine — trace, evidence chips, and a `KNOWN LOCALLY` verdict — before committing any API key. Reachable any time from the empty state or the command palette.
- **Propose Action** *(experimental)* — the model may suggest read-only actions: `search` (with optional path filter), `def` / `refs` symbol navigation, `dir` summaries, `recent` changes — all run locally against in-memory files after a click; `open` opens the viewer, `git` commands are display + copy only. Nothing ever executes without approval; shell is never executed.
- **Exportable traces** — the whole session (answers, traces, and the actual cited lines) as Markdown or a self-contained zero-asset HTML page. Or copy just one: every answer carries a `[ COPY ]` control (that exchange as Markdown), and every evidence chip a one-click copy of its `path:line` + quote.
- **Session cost, always visible** — a live `$` chip in the nav tracks estimated spend (prompt-cache aware) as answers stream, with a one-click reset; it's no longer only a send-time readout.
- **Provider quick-switch** — a nav selector flips between Anthropic, OpenAI, a custom endpoint, and LOCAL without a trip through settings; each provider keeps its own key.
- **Command palette** — `Ctrl-K` in the workbench, plus `Ctrl-E` export, `Ctrl-.` settings, `Ctrl-Shift-O` pick folder, `?` keymap (also a visible `? KEYS` button in the nav).

Honest-labeling rule, upgraded: everything simulated or unbuilt says so on the surface — the landing page's trace console wears a `SIM` chip, unbuilt capabilities wear `ROADMAP` chips, and future pricing wears `PLANNED` chips with a "nothing can be purchased today" note.

## Engine internals — languages, limits, security, self-tests

*(MERIDIAN Engine v0.2-hardened)*

### Recent improvements

- **Resilient trace parsing** — the `meridian-trace` block is recovered even when the model uses ` ```json `, drops the fence, adds trailing commas, or gets cut off mid-JSON. When no trace can be recovered the answer degrades honestly to a `RAW RESPONSE` / `TRACE TRUNCATED` state with a one-click **`[ RE-GROUND & RETRY ]`** (re-runs the local investigation and re-asks with a stricter instruction). A **Force Strict Trace** setting opts noncompliant models into stricter prompting.
- **Multi-language indexing** — symbol and import extraction now covers **Python, Go, Rust** alongside deepened JS/TS (dynamic `import()`, tsconfig `paths` aliases, monorepo workspace resolution). See the matrix below.
- **Faster on large repos** — the symbol/import index no longer rebuilds when you toggle file selection (it depends on content, not selection), the file cap is raised to **8,000**, and token estimates blend a token-regex count for small files with the per-language char divisor for large ones.
- **Hardening** — a pragmatic `<meta>` CSP, custom-endpoint URL validation + a `[ TEST ENDPOINT ]` probe (reachability, CORS, latency), BOM/UTF-16-aware encoding detection, `Retry-After`-aware rate-limit messages with a one-click `[ RETRY ]`, focus-return on every modal, a live-region for screen readers, and dynamic reduced-motion.

### Supported languages & intents

Indexing is regex-based and lightweight (no parser, no dependencies), so depth varies by language:

| Language | Symbols | Imports | Entry points | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| JS/TS | Strong | Strong + aliases | Yes | dynamic `import()`, tsconfig `paths`, workspace resolution |
| Python | Good | relative + top-level | `app.py` / `__main__` | `test_*` + `_test.` recognized |
| Go | Good | block imports | `main.go` | receiver methods (`func (r *R) M()`) |
| Rust | Good | `use` / `mod` | `main.rs` / `lib.rs` | `pub fn` / `pub struct` / `mod` |
| Others (Java/Ruby/C#…) | Basic | — | partial | extension weighting + `class`/`def` only *(ROADMAP)* |

LOCAL-engine intents: `def`, `refs`, `imports`, `importers`, `related`, `symbols`, `structure`, `tests`, `entries`, `recent <n>`, `dir <path>`, `search <text|regex>`, plus plain-language routing. Interpretation questions ("why…", "how should I…") return a `REQUIRES MODEL REASONING` verdict rather than guessing.

### Known limitations

- **Token counts are estimates** (heuristic char/divisor + a token-regex blend, ~±15–20% vs a real BPE tokenizer). Your provider bills the actual counts. The session `$` and spend-limit warnings are estimate-based.
- **Alias / `exports` resolution is best-effort** — tsconfig `paths` and workspace package names resolve; full `package.json` `exports`/`imports` maps and non-relative cross-crate Rust `use` are not.
- **File System Access reload is Chromium-only** — Firefox/Safari lack `showDirectoryPicker`, so saved projects there restore settings/selection only and ask you to re-drop the folder (never file contents, in any browser).
- **Indexing is synchronous** — a multi-thousand-file scan briefly blocks the tab; a progress status is shown first. Tuned for medium repos (~5–8k files).

### Security / CSP

`app.html` ships a Content-Security-Policy `<meta>` tag (GitHub Pages can't set HTTP headers). The workbench's code lives in same-origin ES modules under `app/`, plus exactly one allowed third-party script origin — Tailwind's Play CDN, styling utilities only — so `script-src` is `'self' https://cdn.tailwindcss.com` and inline script injection stays blocked outright (Tailwind's config is the same-origin `app/tw-config.js`, not an inline block). `style-src` keeps `'unsafe-inline'` for the markup's inline `style=` attributes and the `<style>` element Tailwind injects; the rest of the hardening is `object-src 'none'`, `base-uri 'none'`, and a bounded `connect-src` that still permits BYO **https** providers and local model servers:

```
default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://cdn.tailwindcss.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self'; connect-src https: http://localhost:* http://127.0.0.1:*; base-uri 'none'; object-src 'none'; form-action 'self'
```

Tighten `connect-src` to your own provider hosts for a stricter deployment. Note `frame-ancestors` is intentionally omitted — it is ignored in a `<meta>` CSP and needs an HTTP header (or a JS frame-buster) to take effect. The Tailwind CDN receives a page-load request (so, an IP address — disclosed in the privacy policy) but none of your files, questions, or keys; if it is blocked or you're offline, `app/tw-config.js` guards against the missing global and the workbench runs fully on `app/app.css` alone. To return to a zero-third-party build, delete the two Tailwind `<script>` tags and drop `https://cdn.tailwindcss.com` from `script-src` — every load-bearing style lives in `app/app.css`. `index.html` (the landing page) uses the optional goatcounter analytics, so if you add a CSP there it must allow `https://gc.zgo.at`.

### Self-tests

A deterministic self-test suite exercises the index, smart packer, and trace parser against a bundled multi-language fixture — no network, no API. Run it from the command palette (**"Run self-tests (dev)"**), by appending **`?selftest`** to the URL, or with `__meridianSelfTest()` in the browser console (returns the results array). It's honestly labeled `DEV`.

## What's in here

- **[index.html](index.html)** — the MERIDIAN landing page. Single dependency-free file: live Canvas particle field, command palette (`Ctrl-K`), simulated trace console (labeled SIM), FAQ, waitlist form, ceremony/daylight modes, debug panel (`d`).
- **[app.html](app.html)** + **`app/`** — the workbench: markup in `app.html`, styles in `app/app.css`, and the engine as dependency-free ES modules under `app/` (no framework, no npm, no build step — the files ship as authored). Multi-provider key management, folder ingestion (drag-and-drop, picker, or File System Access API — with binary sniffing, ignore-dir filters, and user ignore patterns), the smart context engine (scoring + project map + budgeted packing), IndexedDB project memory, streaming Anthropic/OpenAI-compatible API calls, trace parsing/rendering with evidence chips + a docked file viewer, proposed-action cards, Markdown/HTML trace export, command palette, session cost estimates. Loads exactly **one third-party script** — Tailwind's CDN, utilities only, with a full no-CDN fallback (see Security / CSP).
  - Module map: `main.js` (entry + init order + global keys) · `state.js` (the shared store + cache invalidation) · `config.js` (providers/models/localStorage keys) · `helpers.js` · `shell.js` (provider/model/theme/first-run/settings) · `ingest.js` (folder loading, tree, budget, preview, ignore patterns) · `demo.js` (bundled sample project) · `memory.js` (IndexedDB projects) · `smart-context.js` (scoring + packing + project map) · `indexer.js` (symbols/imports index) · `prompt.js` (context assembly + grounding) · `chat.js` (provider request loop + cost) · `local.js` (the no-API LOCAL engine) · `trace.js` (rendering + trace parsing) · `actions.js` · `viewer.js` · `export.js` · `palette.js` · `selftest.js`.
- **[privacy.html](privacy.html)** / **[terms.html](terms.html)** — the legal layer, written for this exact architecture (no servers, BYO key, localStorage-only storage).
- **[dna.html](dna.html)** — the Lucid Engine design system as a browsable page.
- **[DESIGN-DNA.md](DESIGN-DNA.md)** — the full system spec (v1.2), including a paste-ready instruction block for AI design tools (§10).

## Workbench UI architecture

The workbench is one primary HTML file (`app.html`) whose markup is organized into four fixed regions, driven by dependency-free ES modules. There is no build step — edit, refresh, ship.

### Regions

1. **TopNav** (`nav.primary`) — wordmark, sidebar toggle, live context readout, session-cost chip, provider quick-switch + model select, `⌘K` palette trigger, MD/HTML export, keymap, settings, mode toggle. Controls hide progressively as the viewport narrows; every hidden control remains reachable through the command palette (the palette is a shortcut, never the only path).
2. **Left sidebar** (`aside.rail`) — saved projects, the context engine (dropzone, token-budget bar, `SMART/FULL` + `GROUND` + `PREVIEW SEND`), the project tree (search filter, collapsible directories, tri-state per-directory checkboxes, skipped-file review, ignore-pattern shortcut), and the Project Intelligence panel (`#overview`, rendered by `local.js` — every stat tile runs a real deterministic query). The rail is resizable via the `#railresize` handle (drag, or arrow keys when focused; width persisted in `localStorage`) and collapsible (`Ctrl B`, the nav toggle, or the palette). Below 860px it becomes a full-screen overlay.
3. **Main area** — the chat stage (`section.stage`: streaming messages, trace consoles, evidence chips, composer) plus the **file viewer** (`#viewveil`). At ≥1100px the viewer docks as a third grid column — a non-modal right detail pane with line highlighting and a copy control, so the chat stays interactive while you read evidence. Below 1100px it falls back to a focus-trapped overlay.
4. **Layers** — settings drawer, command palette, keymap, send preview, skipped-files review, first-run modal, toasts. `Esc` always closes the topmost layer (ordering lives in `main.js`).

### The id contract

Modules never query by structure — every JS↔DOM touchpoint is a stable element **id** (`$('tree')`, `$('prompt')`, `$('vbody')`, …). Markup can be rearranged freely (this refactor moved the exports into the nav and the overview into the rail without touching their modules) as long as ids survive. When adding UI: give the element an id, wire it in the owning module's `init*()`, and keep the visible control + palette action pair in sync.

### Components

- **`<template>` components** — repeated rows are cloned from templates at the bottom of `app.html` (`tpl-dir-row`, `tpl-file-row`, used by `ingest.js renderTree()`). Prefer this pattern for any new repeated markup.
- **JS component functions** — richer dynamic pieces (messages, trace steps, evidence chips, stat tiles, demo banner) are built by small builder functions in their owning modules (`trace.js addAiMsg()`, `local.js renderOverview()`, …).
- **Module map** — see *What's in here* above. `main.js` owns init order and global keys; `state.js` is the single shared store; everything else owns its own DOM region and wiring.

### Styling

- **`app/app.css`** is the source of truth: DESIGN-DNA v1.2 tokens (`--paper`, `--accent` Signal Orange `#FF4F00`/`#FF5C0A`, the gray ramp, `--ease-*` easings, `--t-*` durations) on `#app`, with `#app[data-mode="light"]` overrides — both modes always work.
- **Tailwind (CDN)** supplies utility classes only, configured in `app/tw-config.js` to alias the same tokens (`bg-surface`, `text-ink-3`, `ease-snap`, …) with preflight disabled. Never put load-bearing design in utilities: the workbench must survive the CDN being blocked (the config file guards for that, and `.sr-only` has a local fallback).
- Layout is a CSS grid: `main.deck { grid-template-columns: var(--rail-w) minmax(0,1fr) auto }` — the rail width is a custom property set by the resize handle; the third column is the docked viewer (auto → 0 when closed). Breakpoints: ≥1100 three-column, 860–1100 rail + chat with the viewer overlaying, ≤860 single column with the rail as an overlay.
- Motion uses only the DNA's named patterns (Signal Trace, Light Lift, Flare Pulse, Machinery Reveal…), 120–240ms with the custom easings, and everything degrades to instant under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### Extending

- **New command:** add a visible control, then append `{ g, n, k, f }` to `ACTIONS` in `palette.js`; add a `<kbd>` row to the keymap modal if it gets a shortcut (global shortcuts live in `main.js`).
- **New sidebar section:** add a `rail-hd` heading + content inside `.rail-scroll`, wire by id in the owning module.
- **New modal:** copy the `.veil > .modal` pattern, use `rememberFocus()/trap()/returnFocus()` from `helpers.js`, and register it in `main.js`'s `Escape` chain.

## Before public launch — fill the legal placeholders

The legal pages ship with clearly marked placeholders. Find them all with:

```
grep -rn "TODO(drew)" *.html
```

- `[ENTITY]` — your legal name or company (footers, privacy §01, terms §01).
- `[JURISDICTION]` — governing law (terms §15).
- The terms/privacy are strong standard-practice templates tailored to this architecture, **not legal advice** — have an attorney review before charging money or marketing broadly.

## Make the waitlist real

Out of the box the waitlist form falls back to localStorage (entries never leave the visitor's browser, and the page says so). Two steps make it live:

1. **Email capture (required).** Create a free form at [formspree.io](https://formspree.io), copy the id from its endpoint (`formspree.io/f/<id>`), and paste it into the `FORMSPREE_ID` constant in `index.html` (search for `YOUR_FORM_ID`). The page's copy switches to disclose the transmission automatically — and the privacy policy already describes both states.
2. **Analytics (optional).** Create a free site at [goatcounter.com](https://www.goatcounter.com) (privacy-friendly, no cookies, no consent banner needed), then uncomment the snippet at the bottom of `index.html` and replace `YOURCODE`. Never add analytics to `app.html` — the workbench's only permitted third-party request is the Tailwind styling asset, and that boundary is part of the privacy policy.

## Developing / verifying

No build step. Serve locally and click around:

```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

The workbench is ES modules, so it needs to be served over HTTP — opening `app.html` straight from disk (`file://`) won't load the engine. Any static server works; GitHub Pages needs no configuration.

Key flows to check: first-run modal on the workbench (once per browser), folder load with skipped-file report, Send without a key (should prompt, not request), a real question with a spend-limited key (streaming → trace console → evidence chip → file viewer), Stop mid-stream, wrong key (401 state), `[ CLEAR KEY ]` and the clear-all-data button.

## The three laws

1. **Clarity is the price of admission.** Mystery lives in the experience, never in the architecture.
2. **Every element must demonstrate thought.** Decoration that merely signals "designed" gets cut.
3. **Depth is a reward, not a requirement.** Casual users never pay for what explorers earn.

## Depth ladder (try it on the live page)

- **L1** — just read the page.
- **L2** — `Ctrl-K` palette · `t` mode · `g` grid · `d` field debug · `1–5` jump · `?` keymap.
- **L3** — open the browser console.

---

MERIDIAN started as a fictional product built to prove this design system. The workbench made it real. The honest-demo rule still holds: wherever the site simulates or promises, it says so — `SIM`, `ROADMAP`, and `PLANNED` chips mark the line between what runs today and what's on the bench.
